Just to see the difference: _Atrribute 1 with underscore_
* *Attribute 2 with single asterisk*
* **Attribute 3 with double asterisk**
* __Attribute 4 with double underscore__
* Ah so _single underscore_, *single asterisk*, __double underscore__, and **double asterisk** do this
* And now to _**combining single underscore and double asterisk**_ is interesting :sparkles:
